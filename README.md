# to-do-list Rest API
To-do-list Rest API that will serve as the core domain service to multiple tools

Plan of action is to create a matured Rest API that has Pagination and Filtering, as well as correct use of Hateoas Capabilities.

Integration between the following technologies will be added
* MQ
* Batch
* Reverse Proxy
* Lambdas
* Cloud Storage
* Scheduling
* Metrics and tracking

* Lastly UI(Do not count on this one :D )
